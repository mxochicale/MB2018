# Call for Symposia & Workshops
The Scientific Program Committee now invites you to submit Symposia 
& Workshops proposals for Measuring Behavior 2018. 
 
If you are interested in submitting a proposal, please send us an 
outline of 1 page to MB2018 <at> measuringbehavior.org, including 
a title, a 1 paragraph summary, and 4-5 suggested speakers, 
by September 15th 2017.
 

Submission is open for:

Symposia: Sessions organized around a specific topic and organized 
by a symposium chair. The symposium chair and the MB2018 program 
committee will oversee the paper blind review process and the accepted 
papers will be presented in the symposium.

Workshops: Sessions dedicated to hosting interactive discussions 
about novel topics in Measuring Behavior organized by a workshop chair. 
Successful workshops typically would be based around a new or 
disruptive concept or demonstration of new technologies or methodologies. 
Submissions are especially encouraged from industry and research 
centres. If you are unsure if your symposium idea fits with the 
conference, please feel free to contact us at 
MB2018 <at> measuringbehavior.org and we will be very happy to 
discuss it with you.
