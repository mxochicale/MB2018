Nonlinear Dynamics Tools for Movement Variablity
---



Expert from fields of biomechanics to phytiscis have been used
methods of nonlinear dynamics like the takens theorem,
however until recnetly Uzal has proposed the use of nonuniform
state reconsturction which is reprsentes a diffent view of
how these state space reconstructions have been used before
to which many of the current work has been a bit misleading
for that reasong,
the prposed symposium aims to provide further undestanding
of the previous methods with the idea of aliging same theories
and same tools for the use of nonlinear tenchinws.
The following speakers can raise good questions and conclusions
that can find an agreement to which can be the better
methodolgies to provide better unserdtaindg on the variaibluty
of movemtnt using nonlinear dynamics
