Guidelines

# Length of abstracts

Because of the multi-disciplinary nature of the conference, we are flexible about the length of abstracts required.
They must be long enough so that reviewers can judge the quality of your presentation (at least one page not
including figures, about 500 words) but you may also submit a short paper of 7 pages (not including figures and
tables, about 4000 words) if you wish. Abstracts for posters, symposia proposals, workshops, tutorials, and
demonstrations should be about 1 page long.


# Content

It is important that you write for the Measuring Behavior audience. Take a look at previous abstracts on
measuringbehavior.org. Remember to focus on methods and techniques and not on results. Write for a multi-
disciplinary audience. Your abstract will not be accepted if it does not meet those criteria. The contents of your
paper must not have been previously published in a journal or other conference proceedings. However, it is
possible to mention previously published results (with citation) so long as your focus in this paper is on the
methodology, with new information about that aspect.
